# Maximum of two numbers Using Ternary Operator


# The ternary operator in Python is simply a shorter way of writing an if and ifâ€¦else statement


a, b = 10, 20
max = a if a > b else b

print(max)

# print( (b, a) [a < b] )
# print({True: a, False: b}[a > b])
# print(a, " is the grater") if (a > b) else print(b, " is the greater")
